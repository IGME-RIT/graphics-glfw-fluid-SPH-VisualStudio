Description:
In this example we demonstrate the use of SPH to emulate fluid motion.
Fluid mechanics can be implemented in 2 ways: Eularian based or Lagragian
based. Eularian based fluid simulation are done using a grid. There are points
on the grid, and the particles contained within the grid follow a specific set
of rules. In Eularian approach, you need to account for conservation of mass
explicitly.
The lagragian approach accoutns for conservation of mass implicitly, Since each
cluster of particles interact with each other and are separatly accountable.
The lagragian approach, considers the forces caused by all the surrounding particles.
It interpolates between the position of the surrounding particles to get the overall
force acting on the selected particle. This process of interpolation is called SPH.

In SPH, we use smoothing kernels to inetrpolate based on the distance from the particle.
We use different kernels for different "aspects" of fluid properties. For pressure, we
implement a spike kernel, as the pressure sould increase drastically as the distance
gets smaller. But we use a poly6 smoothing kernel for density distributions and surface
tension. We use the gradient or laplacian of the kernel, based on whichever one is more applicable.
For more info see the referenced papers.

In SPH fluid simulation, the particles each consist of mass, velocity and acceleration.
The particles expereince density change, forces due to pressure, Viscosity, surface tension
and collision amongst themselves.

Press "SHIFT" to start simulation
Use "SPACE" to toggle gravity in x-axis, or use "W" to toggle gravity in y-axis.
